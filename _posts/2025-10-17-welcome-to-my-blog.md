## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my cybersecurity blog! I'm excited to share this journey with you.

## About Me

I'm Maks, a software engineer with over a decade of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, cybersecurity has always been an area of interest, and now I've decided to dedicate focused time to developing my skills in offensive security and penetration testing.

## Why This Blog?

As someone who's been in the tech industry for years, I understand the value of documentation and knowledge sharing:

- **Structured Learning** - Writing about challenges and their solutions reinforces understanding and helps identify knowledge gaps.
- **Community Contribution** - Sharing insights and approaches that might help others on a similar path.
- **Professional Development** - Building a public record of skills and methodologies in cybersecurity.
- **Continuous Growth** - Maintaining momentum through consistent practice and documentation.

## What Will Be on This Blog?

You can expect to find:

- **CTF Writeups** - Detailed solutions and methodologies from HackTheBox challenges
- **Technical Notes** - Deep dives into security concepts, tools, and techniques
- **Learning Resources** - Curated materials and insights from my journey
- **Projects** - Security-related experiments and research

## My Learning Path

I've started with **HackTheBox**, focusing on:

- **HTB Academy** - Structured learning paths covering fundamental and advanced security topics
- **HTB Labs** - Hands-on challenges and CTF machines to develop practical penetration testing skills

My background in software engineering provides a solid foundation for understanding system architecture and code-level vulnerabilities, which I'm now applying to offensive security techniques.

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll be covering:

1. My HTB environment setup and workflow
2. CTF writeups from HackTheBox machines
3. Progress through HTB Academy modules
4. Insights and methodologies discovered along the way
